        <p>3.6 million Americans use wheelchairs every day. Another 11.6 million need the assistance of a cane or crutches. For these people, activities that many may take for granted can be the cause of hassle and anxiety. One of these activities is going out to eat.</p>
        <p> A restaurant's wheelchair accessible features are paramount in deciding where to eat on a given night. Accessible Eats tries to simplify this process by leveraging technology and the crowd. By filling out a simple survey, you can help millions of Americans make more informed decisions about where they go out to eat. In some small way, we hope to make life easier for those in wheelchairs.</p>
